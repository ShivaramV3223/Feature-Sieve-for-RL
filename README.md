## Experiments
1) **Feature Sieve Regression**: Experiments on different forget losses for Regression Tasks.
2) **Feature Sieve for Behavioral Cloning**: Showing the effect of Simplicity Bias in RL environments by experimenting on behavioral cloning experiments using Feature Sieve.
3) **Primacy Biasd in RL**: Experimenting on the effectiveness of the proposed forgetting losses on experiments of the primacy paper.
4) **Zero-Shot Transfer in Reinforcement Learning**: Making the simplicity bias problem in Reinforcement Learning into a zero-shot transfer between the domains.
