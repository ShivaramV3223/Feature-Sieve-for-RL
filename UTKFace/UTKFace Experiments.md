# Feature Sieve Regression Experiments
## Dataset: UTKFace

### Dataset Infos:
Dataset consists of total of 23705 datapoints.\
Divided into:
1) Training Dataset of 14223 datapoints.\
2) Validation Dataset of 4741 datapoints.\
3) Test Datset of 4741 datapoints.\

To experiment on simplicity bias, we create biased datasets by biasing the dataset using the attribute gender.\
We have 7470 male datapoints and 6753 female datapoints.\

Here is the image of the training dataset distribution, where blue represents the gender male and red represents the gender female.\
